# Task 4: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## 📌 Objective
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression to predict outcomes based on a given dataset.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Link to dataset

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Preprocessed the data (handled missing values, standardized features).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve
6. Tuned the decision threshold.
7. Explained the sigmoid function and its role in logistic regression.

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: `XX%`
- Precision: `XX%`
- Recall: `XX%`
- ROC-AUC Score: `XX`
